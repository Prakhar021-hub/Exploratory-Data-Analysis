# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

Welcome to the *EDA Projects* repository! This collection includes a variety of exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks focused on uncovering insights, identifying patterns, and preparing datasets for machine learning or statistical modeling.

## Repository Structure

Each subdirectory in this repository corresponds to a separate EDA project. Every project typically includes:
- A Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) or Python script (.py) containing the analysis
- A README.md with project-specific information
- Dataset files (if permitted) or links to the data source

## Projects Included

- *[Project 1: EDA on Titanic Dataset]*
  - Analyzes survival patterns based on features like age, sex, class, and fare.
  - Includes visualizations with seaborn and matplotlib.

- *[Project 2: EDA on Travel dataset]*
  -Analyzes global travel trends, popular destinations, and seasonal patterns using real-world tourism data.
  -Provides insights into traveler behavior, country-wise preferences, and peak travel periods.

- *[Project 3: EDA sleep stress and productivity]*
  - Explores the relationship between sleep quality, stress levels, and productivity across individuals.
  - Highlights correlations and patterns using visualizations and statistical summaries to draw meaningful insights
